# Data Description Document
## Experimental Data Description
### 1.Raw Data:
Data collection was performed using gnuplot, the most commonly used tool in fuzzing. The compressed files contain raw data generated from the experiments, such as crash, queue, input, and output data. These files can be viewed using the gnuplot command in a fuzzing environment on the Linux system.
### 2.Processed_Data:
The data was organized using Origin. Some invalid data was filtered out, and the remaining data was categorized and sorted. Corresponding 2D graphs were generated from the data, where files with the .opj extension are the original Origin files, and .pdf files are the exported versions. The figures included in the thesis are derived from this dataset.
### 3.Compiled_Data:
The data was summarized and organized using Excel, and consolidated into a single Excel spreadsheet. The tables presented in the thesis are sourced from this spreadsheet.
Program File Description
## ffjpeg_global-buffer-overflow-poc:
This is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for the valid vulnerability identified in the ffjpeg file during testing, as described in the article.
